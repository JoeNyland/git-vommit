# git-vommit

How many times have you gone to `git commit` and typed `git vommit` instead? :rage:

As the title suggests, this plugin makes Git vomit, so you learn the hard way *not* to type `git vommit`. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

### WARNING
This is a silly little plugin and should obviously not be installed anyway near a production server. You've been warned!
